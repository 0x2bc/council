## 2. Previous Council's Recommendations

- **0x2bc**: Continue working on Q3 OKRs.
- **0x2bc**: Prepare and roll out the Argo Bridge into production.
- **0x2bc**: Adjust salary allocation per worker from 650 USDT to 550 USDT for SWG, as the council now covers server costs in USDT.
- **0x2bc**: Approve the EMA30 cap (0.01) at the beginning of the term.
- **0x2bc**: Ensure Weekly Twitter meetings are held consistently. Consider hiring a dedicated Twitter manager. Additionally, create a public Marketing events calendar to ensure full DAO synchronization across BWG, CWG, and MWG.
- **0x2bc**: Besides hiring a dedicated Twitter manager, consider hiring a Content Manager. Even a costly Content Manager can be beneficial in terms of ROI (salary less than impact on the market cap).
- **0x2bc**: Follow up on Discretionary Spendings: Labeling System. For more details, visit [https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/960](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/960).
- **0x2bc**: Omit the Weekly Roundup section in the General Stats section of the Council report as it is not necessary.
- **0x2bc**: Revisit the idea of creating comprehensive quarterly or semi-annual reports.
- **0x2bc**: Prioritize future developments carefully, as resources are limited. Ensure that current priority developments contribute significantly to PMF rather than being "nice to have."
- **leet_joy**: submit an WL application for Aerodrome DEX listing as secondary exchange for wrapped JOY on BASE
- **leet_joy**: facilitate launch of AMM on Uniswap for wrapped JOY on BASE and ensure not less than 10K USDT were used at srart
- **leet_joy**: hire MrBovo for developing arbitrage strategy for Hummingbot (BASE <> MEXC)
- **leet_joy**: support content wg with delivering partners section on Gleev
- **leet_joy**: recommend builders to focus on SDK

## 3. Previous Council's Report Feedback

### Comment on CWG and BWG refill

The budget caps the CWG refill at 450,000 JOY and the BWG refill at 1,520,000 JOY. However, we plan to make **a smaller initial refill**, which should be sufficient, for the following reasons.

Please note the following points:

- **BWG Budget Adjustment**: The RWA task for BWG will not be carried out this term, reducing the "Dev salaries" budget from 375,000 JOY to approximately 150,000 JOY. Therefore, the BWG budget will be adjusted as follows: **1,520,000 JOY - (375,000 JOY - 150,000 JOY) = 1,295,000 JOY.** A higher allocation may be considered if the Arbitrage Bot task requires more time than anticipated.
- **CWG Budget Adjustment**: The CWG lead will have limited availability this term and will receive their salary in fully liquid form, with a 0.6 coefficient. It’s recommended to allocate 150,000 JOY tokens for the lead's salary. The CWG budget will be adjusted as follows: **450,000 JOY - (225,000 JOY - 150,000 JOY) = 370,000 JOY.** If additional work hours are reported, a separate refill may be made.
