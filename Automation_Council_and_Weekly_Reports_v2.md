# Objective 

To develop a script that enhances the functionality of the existing reporting tool available at [joy-council-report.vercel.app](https://joy-council-report.vercel.app). The script should be capable of generating two types of reports:

- Users can select the interval for Weekly Report Data (already implemented).
- Users can click a button to generate a text file. This file will contain the Weekly Report Data, compiled with GitHub markup and formatted as follows (new feature):

Format Example: https://github.com/0x2bc/council/blob/main/Weekly_Roundup_Template_For_Automation.md
