Notice: Since last week, we have changed the calculation method. We've applied stricter criteria, which has resulted in slightly lower numbers. Previously, we considered channels as non-empty if anything was uploaded to them, including updated profile images. Now, we only classify channels as non-empty if they contain at least one video.
